One team is led by a regular cast member and the other by a celebrity guest.&nbsp;</p><p>The 33-year-old was recently seen in the independent film She-Ball, which Nick Cannon co-wrote. The film stars Cannon as Avery Watts as he recruits a basketball player to help him win the streetball tournament and save the community center he manages, all while struggling to raise his seven-year-old daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Hitman Holla’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Hitman Holla was revealed to be dating influencer and entrepreneur, Cinnamon.</p><p>Aside from a killer Instagram profile, Cinnamon runs her own online retail store called CINNY.</p><p>She also has a cooking business called Cinny’s Food based in Atlanta, Georgia, where she posts recipes and caters for private events.</p><p>The influencer often posts pictures of herself with Hitman Holla in luxurious locations, such as yachts and private parties, which she shares with her 343,000 followers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Home Invasion</strong></h2><p>In October, news broke that their shared home had been broken into at 1 am on October 12,&nbsp; while Hitman Holla was out of town. It was announced that Cinnamon was in the hospital recovering from severe gunshot wounds.</p><p>Hitman Holla revealed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> that he had been on a Facetime call with his girlfriend at the time of the break-in.</p><p>He informed his followers that four people had broken into their home, and one had shot Cinnamon.</p><p><strong>“Bullet went through her cheek and out the back of her head,”</strong> he said.<strong> “She’s at the hospital now being strong. Send prayers my way cause y’all couldn’t imagine what I’m going through rite now. Pray for me 2 cause I’m ready to lose it all.”</strong></p><p>The rapper claims he was coaching her on what to do the entire time and recalls his fear of losing his girlfriend after she had been shot.</p><p>He praised his girlfriend for putting up a fight when she managed to fire a few rounds at the invaders just before she was shot and asked his followers to pray for her recovery.</p><p>Cinnamon thanked her followers in her own <a href=#>post</a> the next day, telling her followers she appreciated them and <strong>“never knew [she] was this strong till now.”</strong></p><p>The couple constantly updated their respective followers on her recovery, and Cinnamon has been active on social media since then, posting fashion shots that include her neck brace.</p><p>Her fans have been proud of her willpower, evident in how many respond to these photos positively.</p><p>Many of her and Hitman Hollas fans offered their prayers during her recovery and wished her well with each photo she uploaded.</p><p>Since the break-in, she has been active on her personal and professional accounts, proving that nothing can stop her from working on her businesses.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Intimate Leak</strong></h2><p>The two once again went viral on December 15, 2021.</p><p>Hitman Holla was accused of leaking a s*x tape a month ago, but the video has only begun to circulate recently.</p><p>Hitman Holla was quick to clear up rumors brought up amidst the backlash he was facing.</p><p>According to him, the tape was posted to his ‘close friends’ story, and he believes someone in the list screen recorded and leaked the footage on Twitter.</p><p>Cinnamon does not appear to be concerned about the leak, only addressing it in order to clear up rumors.</p><p>On <a href=#>Twitter</a>, Hitman Holla captioned his explanation with the following:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Would never disrespect my girl and post something she didn’t agree to or didn’t like what sense does that make .. but jokes on me okay cool I’ll be fine.”</strong></p><p>Hitman Holla is adamant that Cinnamon knew who the video was going to be shared with, telling his followers that she was aware of every single person on the list.</p><p>He includes the fact that his girlfriend has the final say over what he does and does not post whenever she is involved.</p><p>Twitter has deleted the leaked video for violating its community guidelines, and Hitman Holla hopes people can move on from this as soon as possible.</p><p>Neither party appears to be worried about the opinions of strangers on the Internet, and this will not deter either Cinnamon or Hitman Holla from moving on from the incident.</p><p>This leak is not the first time a celebrity has had intimate photos or videos leaked online. There is virtually no way to stop people from recreating accidental footage with the ability to screen record anything.</p><p>Once something is posted online, there is no way to truly delete it. Hence, despite Twitter removing the video, many copies are currently being circulated online.</p><p>Hitman Holla acknowledges that he was aware of the risk involved with posting a sex tape but appeared to be surprised that someone would choose to circulate it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately for the couple, some Twitter users seemed eager to see more, addressing the shooting Cinnamon experienced two months prior as a means of poking fun at the leak.</p><p>Hitman Holla has not responded to any tweets about the tape, refusing to add anything beyond the explanation he already posted.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC0yK2kmqZdnbytuMBmoKdlmKTBbsPArZyrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-morrison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Morrison News - Us Weekly">&larr;
