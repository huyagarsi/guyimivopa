Now the 38-year-old billionaire sought an emergency order to end the marriage since New York City courts were not accepting filings at the time due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>But in 2008, the California native who shared the role of "Michelle Tanner" on Full House was a central figure in another tabloid-worthy relationship, one that involved the reported death by an accidental overdose of rising superstar,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heath Ledger</a>.</p><h2 id=she-was-called-before-911><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>She Was Called Before 911</span></h2><p>The 10 Things I Hate About You star was found in his Manhattan apartment by his masseuse who called the Passport to Paris actress who was on the actor’s speed dial. The Elizabeth and James designer was told her friend was unconscious and responded by saying she was sending over private security people. Apparently, the masseuse called 911 anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-first-sighting><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Their First Sighting</span></h2><p>The 5-time CFDA winner and I’m Not There actor were originally seen together as far back as 2006 sharing a meal with friends at the storied Los Angeles hotspot, the Chateau Marmont, which was a known place for him to stay with his then-girlfriend, award-winning actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Williams</a> and&nbsp;the couple's newborn.</p><h2 id=their-next-meet-up><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Next Meet-Up</span></h2><p>The Weeds guest star and Casanova actor saw each other again a year later again in LA at a social event. After his Brooklyn home life fell to pieces allegedly due to his refusal to quit his partying lifestyle he seemed to find someone more compatible who, rumor had it, also liked to “party hard.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Who Inherited Heath Ledger's Estate And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><h2 id=it-was-a-rebound-relationship><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>It Was A Rebound Relationship</span></h2><p>Claims were made that the portrayer of the “Joker” was on the heels of his breakup with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawson’s Creek</a> star who had ended their three-year romance even though the couple had a child, Matilde, together. It is said&nbsp;that&nbsp;his relationship with the How the West Was Fun&nbsp;mini-mogul “was based on partying.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-never-actually-confirmed><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>And Never Actually Confirmed</span></h2><p>The Dark Knight star (and rumored award nominee) and The Row designer never went public with their coupledom, maintaining they were merely close friends. The two were allegedly dating casually for three months prior to the fatal incident, hooking up basically because neither busy celebrity was interested in making things exclusive.</p><h2 id=they-were-very-low-key><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Were Very Low-Key</span></h2><p>There were sources who said that the A-listers also enjoyed nights in, just being together watching movies in the rented SoHo loft of the Monster’s Ball actor. Sources also said that the single father confided to MK that he liked being a dad&nbsp;and&nbsp;it was the best thing he’d ever done.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Mary-Kate Olsen’s Ironclad Prenup</a></span></p><h2 id=work-separated-them><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Work Separated Them</span></h2><p>As happens with a lot of young people who are serious about having successful careers, relationships, both romantic and familial, go on the back burner. Whatever was starting between the two Hollywood luminaries got the pause button because she had to attend the Sundance Film Festival in Utah while he went to shoot The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-not-together-his-last-days><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Were Not Together His Last Days</span></h2><p>The week prior to his death, the exhausted actor returned to NYC. His ex had taken their daughter abroad where she was filming. With only one business meeting on his agenda and a lot of downtime where food shopping and drinking alone at a local haunt filled his time, he apparently decided to catch up on his sleep with the help of medication.</p><h2 id=it-wasn-t-her-apartment><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Wasn’t Her Apartment</span></h2><p>Right after the death of the Australian hunk, rumors flew that the New York City apartment he was living in belonged to or was somehow linked to the Olsen sisters, MK specifically. These reports were erroneous and a statement was issued: “Neither Mary-Kate nor Ashley own any apartments in the building where Heath Ledger died.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Heath Ledger's Joker</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-didn-t-voluntarily-co-operate-with-authorities><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Didn’t Voluntarily Co-Operate With Authorities</span></h2><p>The Fosse/Verdon star (and the actor’s baby mama), as well as others in the circle of The Patriot star, agreed to be interviewed by DEA officials. "Everyone has been very eager to help, saying what a great guy Heath Ledger was, everyone except Mary-Kate, who has refused to speak," without first being granted immunity from any future prosecution.</p><h2 id=there-s-a-documentary><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>There’s A Documentary</span></h2><p>Because of his James Dean-like live-fast-die-young demise, a feature-length movie called I Am Heath Ledger was made about the Brokeback Mountain actor in 2017, where friends such as Ben Mendelsohn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Watts</a>, and Djimon Hounsou as well as family of the late actor remembered his life and career. MK did not participate.</p><h2 id=she-issued-a-statement><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Issued A Statement</span></h2><p>"Heath was a friend. His death is a tragic loss."</p><p>Through her attorney’s it was offered: "We have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding Mr. Ledger's death, and the fact that Ms. Olsen does not know the source of the drugs Mr. Ledger consumed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=life-goes-on><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Life Goes On</span></h2><p>As the deceased actor was being autopsied—OxyContin and Vicodin among other drugs were found in his system—MK resumed her life out and about in NYC, back to work at the company owned by herself and her fraternal twin sister <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley</a>, attending Paris Fashion Week, the Met Gala, and promoting her then-latest film The Wackness, as well as a screening of The Dark Knight.</p><p>When interviewed and asked about her former friend, Olsen responded: “I’m not going to comment on that. I won’t give you a word about that in the nicest way possible. Let’s move on.”</p><h2 id=a-final-word-from-ledger-s-dad><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Final Word From Ledger’s Dad</span></h2><p>“It was totally his fault, there is no one else to blame.” In the final hours of the young actor’s life, Kim Ledger and his daughter Kate warned their son/brother against the use of opioids, in an attempt to put a stop to what was clearly an addiction. The star’s doctors, as well as Mary-Kate Olsen, were cleared of any wrongdoing and the investigation was closed, meaning it will probably never be known how Heath Ledger obtained the drugs that ultimately lead to his death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathew Perry Is Living Healthy...
