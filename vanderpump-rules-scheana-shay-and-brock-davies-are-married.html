During a kiki with her bridesmaids, Shay revealed she and Davies were hitched. “I’ve been wearing my wedding band for a while now,” she dished. “Because we were married for a while now.”</p><p>Wait … what?</p><h2 id=h-scheana-reveals-to-her-vanderpump-rules-friends-why-they-were-already-married>Scheana reveals to her ‘Vanderpump Rules’ friends why they were already married</h2><p>Shay’s bridesmaids looked stunned when she shared the revelation. “What the f***, Scheana!” Ariana Madix, who is one of Shay’s closest friends said. But another bridesmaid is heard saying that she knew it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/scheana-and-brock-married.jpg><p>“I am such an open book,” Shay said in a confessional. “It was so <a href=#>hard not to tell everyone</a>. Especially because I’m so happy.”</p><p>She explained to the group, “When his investments and stuff needed to get changed, I also wanted him to be able to get his green card,” she said. “We have a baby together. We know we’re going to be together forever. So we literally just said a couple of words, signed the paper.”</p><h2 id=h-scheana-and-brock-celebrate-their-wedding-during-their-anniversary-week>Scheana and Brock celebrate their wedding during their anniversary week</h2><p>Shay said their Mexican wedding date is their anniversary. “You guys it’s our year anniversary, this week” she smiled. Everyone looked stunned, but a bridesmaid opened her arms and exclaimed, “Congrats on your one year of marriage!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Despite looking shocked, Madix said she was genuinely happy for Shay. “You know what Scheana, so many people want to get married because they want the wedding,” she said. “But you’ve been living the actual marriage. And the wedding is just kind of like a fun little icing on top of the cake.”</p><p>Shay agreed. “We got married for us,” she said in a confessional. And “We did this because we want a life together. We have a baby together and it didn’t matter that it was done in front of 100 people or four people.”</p><h2 id=h-scheana-has-a-dream-wedding-on-vanderpump-rules>Scheana has a dream wedding on ‘Vanderpump Rules’</h2><p>Shay and Davies ended up with their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dream wedding in Mexico</a>. Their daughter Summer Moon served as the flower girl and everyone got emotional while watching Shay walk down the aisle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>But Shay said she was a very different bride the second time around. While standing on the altar, her veil kept blowing in her face. She decided to just take it off, something that would have given her massive anxiety in the past.</p><p>“At my first wedding I was so <a href=#>hyper-focused on every little detail</a> that was going wrong,” she shared in a confessional. “I wasn’t realizing that the marriage itself was wrong. This time around I could be in the back of the SUR alley during gay pride getting married and wouldn’t even care.”</p><p>“It’s not about all these details, but the person,” she added. “And this is my person.”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules is on Wednesday at 9 pm ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnppa7pbHRqaymqF2nwq2x0maqnKCVlruiedKhmLJlkaOxbq7RqJqkZZSWw6qx0maYq51doq6zvsiem2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./turns-to-compost-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Turns to compost">&larr;
