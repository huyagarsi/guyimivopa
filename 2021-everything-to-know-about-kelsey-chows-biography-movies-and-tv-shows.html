She started her acting career from an early age and has played prominent roles in several movies and TV series. Interestingly, Kelsey rose to the mainstream in 2005 following her breakout role in the teen drama series One Tree Hill where she starred as Gigi Silveri; the drama which had in its main cast Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray was a hit for CW. Chow also garnered fame through her performances in other popular TV shows including Pair of Kings, Teen Wolf, and the movie Wind River. From 2017, she began to use her middle name professionally and is now credited as Kelsey Asbillie.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Kelsey Chow Hails From An Interesting Heritage">Kelsey Chow Hails From An Interesting Heritage</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Her Passion For Acting Was Ignited Through Dance and Theater">Her Passion For Acting Was Ignited Through Dance and Theater</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="From One Tree Hill To Yellowstone, The Actress Has Had Quite A Smooth Career">From One Tree Hill To Yellowstone, The Actress Has Had Quite A Smooth Career</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="What We Know About The Actress’s Love Life">What We Know About The Actress’s Love Life</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kelsey-chow-hails-from-an-interesting-heritage></span><strong>Kelsey Chow Hails From An Interesting Heritage</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Upon first glance at Kelsey, one is bound to wonder what her roots could be. This ethnic ambiguity is something that has given the actress the opportunity to fit into many roles, and she absolutely loves it. In a competitive space such as Hollywood, having a physical attribute that makes you versatile is definitely an advantage.</p><p>Her father Jim Chow is Chinese and was born to Chinese immigrants in America, while her mother, Jean Chow is a descendant of White and Indigenous Americans. Kelsey was born to them on the 9th of September 1991 in Columbia, South Carolina.</p><p>In August 2017, the New York Times reported that the actress identified herself as one of the descendants of Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians – the federal recognized Indian tribe in the United States. However, a month later, the tribe released an official statement stating that she has never been an enrolled member. Kelsey might have made this claim due to her mother’s roots from white indigenous peoples.</p><p>Kelsey Asbille Chow speaks and understands Chinese fluently. She was raised alongside two siblings; a brother who is two years younger and a sister who 8 years younger.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pT0_Kn7PN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-passion-for-acting-was-ignited-through-dance-and-theater></span><b>Her Passion For Acting Was Ignited Through Dance and Theater</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Atypical of most actors, Kelsey Chow’s love for acting began from high school. She attended Hammond High School where she was very active in the drama department featuring in several plays.</p><p>She was a part of the Hammond Select Ensemble which performed extensively in Italy and other parts of Europe. As she became more active in community theater, she made up her mind upon pursuing acting as a career.</p><p>Upon high school graduation, she enrolled at Columbia University not to study theater but Human Rights. Beyond acting, the actress does have other interests. Inspired by her grandmother who in her time graduated top of her medical class and went on to work with the WHO in North Africa in the fight against tuberculosis, Kelsey Chow has stated that she would love to work along the lines of public health.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=from-one-tree-hill-to-yellowstone-the-actress-has-had-quite-a-smooth-career></span><strong>From One Tree Hill To Yellowstone, The Actress Has Had Quite A Smooth Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2005, when Kelsey Chow was still in high school, she got her first professional acting gig. It was the recurring role of Gigi Silveri, the girlfriend of “Mouth” (a character played by Lee Norris) in the hit CW teen drama One Tree Hill. Her role lasted for the next four years providing the actress an opportunity to learn from already established actors.</p><p>With ample visibility from such a hit show, Kelsey Chow was set up for a successful career in Hollywood. While on OTH, Chow earned a minor role in a 2008 episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Up next, she played the role of Matisse Burrows in the 2010 Disney Channel Original Movie, Den Brother that starred G Hannelius.</p><p>That same year, the actress booked her first main TV role – the role of Mikayla Makoola in the Disney XD sitcom Pair of Kings which was specifically targetted at teenagers. The series which also featured Adam Hicks lasted from 2010 to 2013.</p><p>During her time on the series, Kelsey Chow booked her first two movie gigs, the first was a small part in the Marvel Comics superhero film, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and the other was in the 2013 romantic drama film, The Wine of Summer. She also played the role of Emily Baltimore in the feature film, Run (2013)</p><p>However, the actress would continue to find more gigs in the small than on the big screen. In 2014, she appeared in an episode of the ABC Family sitcom Baby Daddy before booking the part of Lotus Tenry in the pilot episode of the action-drama series Hieroglyph which unfortunately was unsold.</p><p>Kelsey Chow’s next major gig came in yet another teenage focused series, MTV’s Teen Wolf. She played the recurring role of Tracy Stewart for 13 episodes from 2015 to 2016. Within that time frame, she appeared in the 2015 film, Full of Grace.</p><p>Afterward, she played the lead character of Marissa in the 6 episodes of Embeds in 2016, then came a role in the TV film, Brimming with Love and a recurring role that lasted two episodes in ABC’s Splitting Up Together.</p><p>Kelsey Chow had the opportunity to appear alongside big stars like Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen in the 2017 neo-Western murder mystery film, Wind River as written and directed by Taylor Sheridan who has won a handful of awards for his directing. The movie was nominated for and won a couple of minor awards.</p><p>Asibille on her next major role got to work yet again with the renowned filmmaker Taylor Sheridan in his TV series&nbsp;Yellowstone which premiered on June 20, 2018, on the Paramount Network. The series which follows the Dutton family and their land border conflict with an Indian reservation and land developers also star Kevin Costner, Wes Bentley, and Kelly Reilly.</p><p>Asibille plays the role of Monica Dutton one of the members of the Dutton family that controls the largest contiguous ranch in the United States.</p><p>Having premiered to mixed critical reviews, Yellowstone by its third episode became the most-watched television series on an ad-supported cable bested only by AMC’s The Walking Dead.</p><p>In addition to acting, the actress has appeared in a couple of music videos including the video for Hayley Kiyoko’s song, “Girls Like Girls.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-we-know-about-the-actresss-love-life></span><strong>What We Know About The Actress’s Love Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite her above-average activity on social media, Kelsey Chow does not seem to be one to share details of her romantic life. Her only relationship to make it to the media light was with English actor William Moseley. That was in 2015, both made a couple of red carpet appearances including a red carpet event for the premiere of Moseley’s series The Royals held at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, London. It has since been quiet from the two, thus details of when and why they broke up are unknown to the media.</p><p>While Chow has never publicly spoken about her sexuality, some quarters believe that she might be a lesbian or bisexual following her portrayal of a lesbian character in the video for Hayley Kiyoko’s Girls Like Girls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35usdWeqbKsmJ67qHnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqOVocCmxYycn6ivo2KvqrvGq5ipoKliurDCyJ6qZpmemXq1woysn6ivo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ivan-hernandez-wiki-bio-age-height-family-wife-kids-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ivan Hernandez Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Family, Wife, Kids, Movies, Tv Shows, and Net Worth">&larr;
