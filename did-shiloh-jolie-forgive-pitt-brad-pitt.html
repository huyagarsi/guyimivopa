At that time, it was reported that Pitt was intoxicated and his anger was through the roof. This caused things to get physical between Pitt and Jolie, which allegedly harmed Jolie on the flight. <a href=#>The plane incident also marked the end of Pitt being on speaking terms with his kids</a>.</p><p>It was reported that Pitt and Jolie's kids got involved. Maddox Jolie was later named as being one of the two children who were directly involved in the altercation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maddox was reported to have been "intentionally or inadvertently" struck by Pitt</a>.

She was also awarded temporary sole custody of the children. But in May 2021, that changed when Pitt was awarded 50-50 legal and physical custody of the five kids who were still minors, including Zaraha Jolie, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Pax Jolie-Pitt, Knox Jolie-Pitt, and Vivienne Jolie-Pitt.

Pitt has been on the receiving end of over the past handful of years. Because of this,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fans believe that Pitt or his team was somehow involved in the positive update on the relationship between Pitt and Shiloh</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-at-press-conference.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"InTouch is published by a360 Media previously known as American Media Inc (AMI)," one fan wrote.

Despite this fact, many are still hopeful that Pitt and Shiloh, as well as the rest of his children, are on the path to rebuilding their relationships.</p><p>That may ultimately prove to be easier said than done with the older kids, however.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-39-s-relationships-with-his-other-children-has-been-strained>Brad Pitt's Relationships With His Other Children Has Been Strained</h2><h3 id=brad-pitt-39-s-relationship-with-his-old-kids-pax-maddox-and-zahara-may-be-beyond-repair>Brad Pitt's relationship with his old kids Pax, Maddox, and Zahara may be beyond repair</h3><p>Pitt's reliance on alcohol and other substances over the years has put a strain on his relationship with his six children. That, in conjunction with his absence from their lives as a result of not having custody for a time, has led to major repairs needing to be done to patch things up between Pitt, Shiloh, Zahara, Maddox, Pax, Vivienne, and Knox. Unfortunately, with some of the kids, the damage done may be beyond repair.</p><p>In 2020, it was reported that Pitt's relationship with Maddox had not been repaired since the incident on the plane. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The relationship between Pitt and Maddox was "non-existent."</a></p><p>"With Maddox overseas [for college], Brad is also hopeful that Pax will also be interested in reconnecting without the influence of his older brother," a source stated. However, an <a href=#>Instagram post that Pax wrote in 2020 was leaked in November 2023</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That post dashed any hopes of reconciliation, perhaps ever</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-and-his-children-1.jpg><p>"You time and time and again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person," Pax wrote. "You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence. You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you're incapable of doing so."</p><p>Approximately a week before that Instagram post was leaked, Zahara attended a sorority event with Jolie by her side. At the event, Zahara had to introduce herself to the room. <a href=#>When Zahara introduced herself, the surname "Pitt" was left off of her name</a>. It has been speculated that the relationship between Zahara and Pitt is on the rocks as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By all accounts, the relationship between Pitt and Vivienne and Knox appears to be the strongest of his children. This has been speculated to be because they were so young when the marriage between Pitt and Jolie ended that they do not recall any of the less happy times in the household.</p><p>While there were years when Pitt was away from them because of sole custody being given to Jolie, since he has been awarded joint custody, Pitt has the twins in his care as much as Jolie does, suggesting that while all may be lost with Shiloh and Pitt's other children, the twins might still be close with their dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLWquM6hZKOnnJ6ybrLOq56irpVivarA02aZq5mUYr2qwNNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./travis-kelce-addresses-taylor-swifts-karma-lyric-change.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Kelce Addresses Taylor Swift's 'Karma' Lyric Change">&larr;
