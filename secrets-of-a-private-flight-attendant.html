The line-up went something like this: sexy black secretary-style suit comprising a pencil skirt and jacket, nipped and tucked and ending mid-hip; tailored black trousers; a classic fitted black dress; virgin wool charcoal pea coat with fur trim detail; four cream blouses – sheer, but not completely see-through; a cardigan; Hermès silk neck scarves; couple of skinny leather belts – both Prada; a handbag, also Prada; footwear by Salvatore Ferragamo – a pair of heels and knee-high boots for on the ground, and two pairs of ballet pumps to wear in the air.

She told how the work took her from spa resorts to the Caribbean, Dubai to New York, African safaris to theme parks in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The pay was pretty much the same across the board for freelancers: around $450 in wages, plus $125 in living expenses, per day,’ she explained.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The only financial drawback was that I no longer had a&nbsp;company credit card, which meant I had to sign up for another one myself.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There tends not to be a chef on the smaller jets, meaning all catering responsibilities are upon the flight attendant. If a client wants fifty bottles of Dom Pérignon, I would need to buy fifty bottles of Dom Pérignon.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It would also be my duty to buy flowers and any other accessories for the client, as well as buying all of the food and preparing all meals on board.
