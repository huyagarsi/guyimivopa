Over the course of the season, she was one of several directors and directed three total episodes. After eight seasons on air, the show returned for a final ninth season before ending in April of 2012.</p><p>Lenz then decided to focus on other projects that she thought would take her career in a direction that "One Tree Hill" had not.
