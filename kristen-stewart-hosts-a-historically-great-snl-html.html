One of the most historic and beloved shows in television history, SNL owes a lot of its legacy to the early years of Ivy League-informed, comparatively uncensored <a href=#>political commentary</a>. One can’t help but wonder how original head writer Michael O’Donoghue – a brilliant and <a href=#>unapologetically insane</a> National Lampoon co-founder and a pioneer with <a href=#>his unique brand</a> of socially-focused black comedy – might spin things in 2017.</p><figure data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/giphy/instances/splitsider-cjh9ieskq00dtsd847h9djt5m@published class=giphy data-editable=url></figure><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034alxmc9h2vukmm@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034blxmcl541inh1@published data-word-count=119>But through decades of cast turnovers, increased network and sponsor involvement, and the rise of the 24-hour news cycle, SNL – once the only source of edgy, topical commentary – has been buried by, among other things, Twitter, where a million aspiring Weekend Update anchors offer wry and hyper-timely hot takes without worrying about offending anyone. Michael O’Donoghue didn’t have to answer to Comcast execs, and SNL, which premiered the year after Nixon’s resignation, would never have had the disgraced politician appear on air. But in a year that saw a 30% rise in the show’s space for product placements, and the election of a controversial former host, SNL shares little but a legacy with its former, risker years.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034clxmc0elausqc@published data-word-count=84>Which is why it was so damn refreshing to see so many shining, truly opinionated moments in this week’s episode. Sure, pleasing everyone is tricky, but the political climate is more divisive than ever, and it’s (arguably?) the time for loud voices to take advantage of their volume – so there’s been a lot of criticism aimed SNL’s way, by people (like me) who hold on to hope that a comedy show calling the president a “little white bitch” might help change the world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034dlxmcrgx46go6@published data-word-count=74>It won’t, probably. But this week, SNL – helmed by first-time host Kristen Stewart, who was so awesome and adorable and excited to be there – seemed to hit the stride its been struggling to find for awhile. From the <a href=#>continuing references</a> to Bannon’s behind-the-scenes maneuverings to a monologue highlighting Don’s bizarre obsession with celebrity to Melissa McCarthy’s seriously masterful jab at the current admin’s sheer ineptitude, this week’s episode&nbsp;pushed all the right buttons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034elxmcerxzxho2@published data-word-count=4><strong>Oval Office Cold Open</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034flxmc4gx1oyjz@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034glxmcoz7mrtf8@published data-word-count=63>It’s still a little weird, though, when Skeletor-Bannon – portrayed as a cackling ghoulish overlord, as in life&nbsp;– enters to laughter and applause, because those are sounds of approval and that is not what this man (even a caricatured version) should elicit. Sort of same with Don played as a harmless baby, puppeted into fits of rage and placated with colors and puzzles.</p><figure data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/giphy/instances/splitsider-cjh9ieskq00e0sd843ho3cim8@published class=giphy data-editable=url></figure><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034hlxmcadchxas0@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034ilxmc14o0wz6o@published data-word-count=58>But then, if he was Hitler-ier, he’d probably be flattered, and like we said, this is all very hard to pull off. So, let’s just give Kenan Thompson one billion life points for screaming “You cannot even walk down stairs, you little white bitch” at an effigy of Trump with such passion it almost didn’t seem like acting!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034jlxmc6hir6vz2@published data-word-count=1><strong>Monologue</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034klxmcmbue2m8z@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034llxmc824q6des@published data-word-count=125>Every single person who watched this monologue wants to be Kristen Stewart’s best friend now. From her Veronica Lodge-takes-Manhattan fishnet ensemble&nbsp;to her compulsive hand-wringing and her gossipy speculation on Don’s obsession with her ex to the “um yup whatever”-ness of her casual&nbsp;“I’m like, so gay, dude,” this girl owns every room without even realizing it. She was clearly so into being there (and so comfortable in front of an audience) that when she let an F-bomb drop, she seemed crestfallen, since Lorne’s made such a huge issue of it in the past (sowwie, Jenny Slate and Casey Wilson). But given how goddamn good this episode was thanks to her (and the fact that it’s not 1974) we’re thinking it’s probably not a huge deal anymore.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034mlxmcs3wspyfi@published data-word-count=2><strong>Welcome Video</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034nlxmcay7s7j0n@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c7034olxmcbq3x13bd@published data-word-count=77>With all these executive orders flying around, the government must be rushing to keep all their <a href=#>websites</a> and whatever up to date – probably, SNL is doing them a favor by putting together this TSA welcome video that concisely and politely explains our new customs process to prospective travelers.

Granted, Roald Dahl was a <a href=#>pretty twisted motherfucker</a>, so its no surprise his stories tended to focus on families with dark and bizarre backstories (lots of orphans, and abusive parents, and <a href=#>Struwwelpeter</a>-violent warnings to young readers that bad behavior earns really bad punishments) – so it’s natural to wonder, what if Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was really about a family that lied to a poor little boy?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035hlxmcx49yenqu@published data-word-count=1><strong>Etc</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035ilxmczz9jwjy5@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035jlxmcv48krfuq@published data-word-count=240></p><li>I was as surprised as anyone when, in 2014, Pete Davidson joined the SNL cast; widely known as a Guy Code franchise fave, Davidson is also an incredibly strong standup comic who just keeps getting better (there are glimpses of this in his frequent, scripted Update bits, but they don’t do his style justice – his recent <a href=#>Comedy Central special, SMD</a>, is a real gem). Back then, Davidson had a lot of heat as a New Face to Watch-type, with a compelling background (he lost his dad on 9/11, and doesn’t shy away from talking about it onstage), and an irresistible charm that could make even the rowdiest NYC club crowd quiet down and pay attention – and he was only 20! Late night sets, specials, maybe a scripted series offer – anything seemed possible. But SNL? That came out of left field. While there are haters who dismiss rookie players and/or standups who try to take on sketch, for the past two and a half seasons Davidson has settled into the show with true ease, making up for any lack of experience with an obvious fearlessness towards the random assortment of roles he’s been handed. This week especially, Davidson stood out for his exceptional work in “Meet Cute” and enthusiasm in “Golden Ticket”, but also because seeing him kill it made me realize he’s been killing it on the regular for 2+ seasons – and that’s pretty fucking dope.</li><figure data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/giphy/instances/splitsider-cjh9ieskr00f3sd84wdx92bjt@published class=giphy data-editable=url></figure><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035klxmcdvtj5yuo@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035llxmchxffl7iu@published data-word-count=15></p><li>Next week: Alec Baldwin hosts (hopefully not completely in character), with musical guest Ed Sheeran.</li><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3j5c8035mlxmcddvs1ak6@published data-word-count=0></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Kristen Stewart Hosts a Historically Great ‘SNL’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocGdgZ3ysvsisq56mXajBpsPAq6tmoJ%2BowbR5wGafoqukpL%2Bqr8Clo7Jll6eyosCMrKWlZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-jenner-holographic-scoop-neck-swimsuit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner Kicked Off Hot Girl Summer in a Holographic Scoop-Neck Swimsuit">&larr;
