She was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Dominican parents who immigrated to the United States in pursuit of the American dream. Despite their humble beginnings, they instilled in their daughter the importance of hard work and determination. These values have served Ramyr well throughout her life.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Ramyr attended college where she studied business administration. It was during her time in college that she met her future husband, Daym Drops. The two hit it off immediately and were married shortly after graduation.</p><p>Since then, Ramyr has been a stay-at-home mom to their two children. In her spare time, she enjoys cooking, baking, and spending time with her family. She is also an active member of her community, often volunteering for local organizations.<strong> Who Is Ramyr Gonzalez, Daym Drops’s Wife?</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ramyr-gonzalez-daym-dropss-wife></span>Ramyr Gonzalez, Daym Drops’s Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ramyr Gonzalez’s entrepreneurial spirit has led her to start her own business. She is the owner of a successful online store called “Ramyr’s Boutique.” The store specializes in stylish and affordable clothes for women of all shapes and sizes. Ramyr’s passion for fashion and business comes together perfectly in her boutique, which has quickly become a popular destination for fashion-savvy ladies.</p><p>In addition to her business ventures, Ramyr is also an active social media influencer. She frequently posts about her life as a wife and mother on her popular blog, “Ramyr’s World.” Her blog is a go-to source for advice on parenting, marriage, and homemaking.</p><p>Ramyr Gonzales is a woman of many talents. She is a loving wife and mother, a successful entrepreneur, and a respected social media influencer. She is an inspiration to all who know her and proof that anything is possible with hard work and determination.</p><p>Daym Drops has announced the release of her better half Daym’s new Netflix series Fresh, Fried, and Crispy, which will premiere on June 9th, 2021. Furthermore, food reviewer Daymon Patterson is a well-known figure who rose to prominence after uploading a number of exceptional films to YouTube under his stage moniker Daym Drops.</p><p>Daym’s debut viral video, a review of Five Guys Burgers and Fries in 2012, was the harbinger of a viral song that swept the internet in 2013. Daym’s likable features and clever wit aided him in quickly gaining popularity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ramyr-gonzalez-is-it-cake-judge-daym-drops-wife></span>Ramyr Gonzalez: Is It Cake Judge Daym Drops Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ramyr Gonzales is a well-known American food reviewer and YouTube star who is also a television host and rapper. Ramyr’s marital status with Daym has not been in the news recently, but she has remained an unknown figure until now. Aside from that, Gonzales’ anonymity was kept prior to this.</p><p>As a result, at the moment, we know very little about the wife of the food critic. Ramyr has been an unwavering supporter of her husband’s professional ambitions, and she has remained by his side throughout his highs and lows. Daym and Ramyr also knew one another before Daym’s rise to culinary acclaim. In a similar vein, the pair married in 2012 in a brief but beautiful ceremony that was later aired on Daym’s YouTube channel.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=daym-drops-divorces-his-wife-ramyr-gonzales></span>Daym Drops Divorces His Wife: Ramyr Gonzales<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ramyr Gonzales’ age has become the most discussed issue of the day. We haven’t been able to discover Ramyr’s birth date or age, however. She hasn’t revealed anything about her personal life thus far, in the same way she hasn’t said anything about her family. Ramyr’s age has not been determined yet, and her date of birth is unknown.</p><p>Her face appears to be about thirty years old; however, the facts have not yet been confirmed by official websites. Furthermore, based on her appearance, we may guess Ramyr’s age to be between 40 and 45 years old; nevertheless the truth has not yet been established.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=daym-drops-age></span>Daym Drops Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Daym Drops, Ramyr’s husband, will be 44 years old in 2022, according to the most recent available data. Dylan’s official birth certificate, he was born on September 24, 1977, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the United States. Dylan and Ramyr are the parents of two children.</p><p>Daym’s first marriage produced his eldest child, Daij, while his younger daughter, Kaitlyn Patterson, was conceived shortly after he and Ramyr exchanged wedding vows in their second union.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ramyr-gonzales-net-worth></span>Ramyr Gonzales Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of now, nobody knows how much money Ramyr Gonzales makes.
