The future!” Chinatown’s plot involving <b>the manipulation of Los Angeles’ water supply</b> led to the character inspiration. “We knew we were enterting a western genre, and we wanted currency, but not money.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_the_snake_really_rangos_brother></span><strong>Is the snake really rangos brother?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Role. Early in the film, Rango claims that <b>Rattlesnake Jake is his brother</b> when he is first brought up by the townspeople while making up his overblown heroic persona; thus, when Jake attacks the town, he uses this bold-faced lie to expose Rango as a phony in front of everyone and drive him out of town.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_villain_in_Rango></span><strong>Who is the villain in Rango?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>The Honorable Mayor Marlon Carlton Tortoise John Lynch</b> is the true main antagonist of the film Rango.

During the film, Rango later finds out that the Mayor was actually the one who shut off the water supply to Dirt. … He then <b>put Rango and Beans into the vault of the glass-bottle bank to drown them</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Rango_based_on_Django></span><strong>Is Rango based on Django?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>So far, “Rango” looks poised to open fairly strongly. “Rango” — which partly spoofs the 1966 Western <b>“Django</b>” — has been mostly well-received by critics. The film’s Rotten Tomatoes score is “84,” and it has a “75” on Metacritic.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_bad_bill_in_Rango></span><strong>What is bad bill in Rango?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bad Bill is a major antagonist in Nickelodeon’s 23rd feature film Rango.

By <b>the end of the movie, Jake seems to have developed respect for him</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_beans_freeze_in_Rango></span><strong>Why did beans freeze in Rango?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Rango says that ‎”he may have had his reasons,” causing Beans to get offended, <b>start yelling at Rango</b>, and abruptly freezes in her tracks.
