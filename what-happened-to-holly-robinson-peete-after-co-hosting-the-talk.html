After years of acting, Peete's career changed when she was tapped to co-host The Talk during the daytime show's first season.</p><p>Over the years, many talk show hosts have garnered headlines. For example, fans were shocked when <a href=#>Rosie O'Donnell confronted Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres once made Sharon Stone uncomfortable</a>.</p><p>Unlike those stars and her former co-host <a href=#>Sharon Osbourne who transformed herself</a>, Peete's talk show tenure has largely been forgotten. That is a shame since Peete's life since leaving The Talk deserves a lot more attention.</p><h2 id=is-holly-robinson-peete-still-acting-now>Is Holly Robinson Peete Still Acting Now?</h2><p>When Holly Robinson Peete was a young woman still trying to get her career off the ground, she landed several notable acting roles. Most notably, Peete starred in the shows 21 Jump Street and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper between the late '80s and late '90s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hangin-with-mr-cooper-cast-photoshoot.jpg><p>In addition to Peete's most notable roles, she appeared in several other projects before the 2010s. For example, Peete starred in the miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream as Diana Ross. Peete also starred in several mostly forgotten shows like For Your Love, Like Family, and Love, Inc.</p><p>In 2010, acting took a backseat for Peete as she began a new phase in her career. Tapped as one of The Talk's first co-hosts, Peete took the helm for the first season but she left the talk show before the next season started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sharon-osbourne-slams-ashton-kutcher-calling-him-the-rudest-celeb-she-s-ever-met.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ashton Kutcher's Appearance On The Talk Turned Into A Nightmare After Sharon Osbourne Got His Name Wrong</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Osbourne did not hold back when talking about a bad experience with Ashton Kutcher.</span><p>Since Peete's The Talk tenure ended, she has landed roles in several movies and TV shows. Arguably one of her most amazing post-The Talk roles was the cameo role she took in the film adaptation of 21 Jump Street. The reason for that is Peete got to portray her character from the original show for the first time in more than three decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-really-happened-to-holly-robinson-peete-co-hosting-the-talk.jpg><p>Since 2015, the main focus of Peete's acting career has been TV movies. Between 2015 and 2022, Peete starred in ten TV movies, most of which were Christmas-themed. Peete also had recurring roles in the shows Mike & Molly as well as Chicago Fire after her time co-hosting The Talk ended.</p><p>It also should be noted that Peete has shown up in a single episode of several notable shows. Some of Peete's credits include appearances in shows like Instant Mom, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-holly-robinson-peete>What Happened To Holly Robinson Peete?</h2><p>In the years since Holly Robinson Peete stopped starring in Hangin' with Mr. Cooper and The Talk, her life has stayed the same in some ways. Most notably, Peete is still married to the former NFL quarterback Rodney Peete, and they've continued to parent their four children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/holly-robinson-peete-and-her-husband-rodney-peete-smiling-together.jpg><p>However, the focus of Peete's personal life has changed dramatically in some other ways. A perfect example of that is Peete and her family decided to let their personal life be put under the spotlight in a big way.</p><p>During the early to mid-2010s, Peete began to dip her toe in the pool of reality TV. During that time, the actor appeared in shows like Say Yes to the Dress, Wife Swap, and Celebrity Family Feud among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Peete's flirting with reality TV went to another level when she and her family began starring in their own reality show. Between 2016 and 2019, Peete and her family starred in For Peete's Sake and Meet the Peetes. Peete also notably competed in a season of The Masked Singer.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/leah-remini.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Leah Remini Didn't Care For Her Firing From The Talk, Revealing CBS Constantly Had To Work Around Publicists Requests During Their Interviews</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Leah Remini's exit from The Talk came with a lot of controversy behind the scenes.</span><p>Peete's career in the entertainment industry also has garnered headlines over the last several years. In March 2021, Peete used Twitter to allege that she'd been fired from The Talk for a disturbing reason. According to Peete's Tweet, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of her former The Talk co-hosts got her fired</a>.</p><p>"I'm old enough to remember when Sharon complained that I was too 'ghetto' for #theTalk...then I was gone. I bring this up now bc I was mortified watching the disrespectful condescending tone she took w/her co host who remained calm & respectful because...she HAD to. 🤦🏽‍♀️ 🤷🏽‍♀️ #fbf."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to Peete's post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Osbourne completely denied that allegation</a> in a tweet of her own. Osbourne also shared a screenshot of an email she claimed was from Peete. In the email, Peete seemed to be blaming Julie Chen Moonves for her The Talk exit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-talk-s-former-co-hosts-on-the-shows-set.jpg><p>Aside from Peete's career, the actor and reality star has led an admirable life over the last several years. Since the 2020s began, Peete has garnered headlines for speaking out about social issues.</p><p>In 2022, Peete spoke out following an incident involving her former Hangin' with Mr. Cooper co-star Mark Curry. Just before Christmas of that year, Curry revealed that he was standing in a hotel lobby when security demanded to know if he was a guest of the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the 26-minute video that Curry took of the incident, security continued to demand he identify if he was a paying guest or not. As Curry also documented in the video, he was followed everywhere he went in the hotel.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-30t125829-809.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Guest Nick Cannon Desperately Tried Getting On His Talk Show So Other Celebs Would Stop Avoiding His Invite</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There was one guest in particular that could've changed things for Nick Cannon, and perhaps, given the daytime talk show the exposure it needed.&nbsp;</span><p>As Curry later made clear, he was a guest of the hotel and was staying in one of the suites. Curry refused to initially tell security that since he didn't believe other people would be treated the same way if they were in the lobby. "If you're Black and you're in Colorado Springs, you can't be in the lobby."</p><p>After this incident, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peete offered her support to her former co-star</a> in a tweet. "Sending love out to my costar and friend @MARKCURRY… just finding out about this awful profiling harassment he was subjected to in Colorado Springs. I hope the Hotel has apologized to him at least🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ UNACCEPTABLE 😡"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/holly-robinson-peete-and-mark-curry-at-a-hollywood-walk-of-fame-ceremony.jpg><p>Peete has also spoken out trying to bring attention to the health issue she dealt with in hopes of helping others with the same problem. In 2023, Peete spoke to the website Shondaland about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her struggles with having an overactive bladder</a>.</p><p>Most notably, Peete and her husband Rodney Peete founded The HollyRod Foundation. A charitable foundation, it was set up to help people who suffer from Parkinson's Disease. Peete was inspired to found The HollyRod Foundation because her father was diagnosed with Parkinson's in his forties.</p><p>On the website brainandlife.org, this is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how The HollyRod Foundation's efforts are described</a>. "A foundation that provides financial, medical, and emotional support to people with Parkinson's."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brTOpaOyZaKkr6q60qilZqiVmsGmecCfq56qXZi8brTOrKuippdiwamxjK2YpaNf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./angie-beavin-bio-age-wlex-family-husband-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angie Beavin WLEX Husband: Bio, Age, Family, Net Worth">&larr;
