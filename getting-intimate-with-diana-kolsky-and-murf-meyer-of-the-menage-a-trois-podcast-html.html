The Ménage à Trois radio podcast is hosted by “real life lovers” Diana Kolsky and Murf Meyer. Every week they invite a new guest like Ilana Glazer, Chris Gethard, or Amy Poehler on the show to talk about love, sex and overall horniness. Both are regular performers at UCB New York and in fact do a raunchy live Ménage à Trois show every month at the theater (<a href=#>the next one is Friday the 25th</a>). She’s a standup comedian and improviser and has been seen on <i>The Chris Gethard Show</i> doing random weird characters as well as in videos for sites like Above Average<i>. </i>He’s a regular and the announcer on <i>The Chris Gethard </i>show and is also a writer, improviser and has been seen in shows like <i>Broad City</i>. Together they’re so charming and funny, they make you want to jump right in bed with them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzejn8k0yeare84zeenqpx7@published data-word-count=20><b>Hello Lovers!

We recently had one where we started talking about whale penises and someone was explaining it to us, I think it was Jen Jaffe, how different genitals on different animals work. She’s been very interested about it and has been reading up on it. We talked about these humpback whales penises and we ended up looking at a video of that.
